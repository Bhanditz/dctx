# dctx

A context package for use across docker projects. The goal is to maintain full
compatibility with
[golang.org/x/net/context](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context).

This was formerly [github.com/docker/distribution/context](https://godoc.org/g
ithub.com/docker/distribution/context) and will be adapted to be more
generally useful.
